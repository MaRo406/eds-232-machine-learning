    "text": "Course Description\nMachine learning is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that “learn,” that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. In this course, we focus on the core concepts of machine learning that beginning ML researchers must know. We cover “classical machine learning” primarily using R and explore applications to environmental science. To understand broader concepts of artificial intelligence or deep learning, a strong fundamental knowledge of machine learning is indispensable."

By the end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nExplain key machine learning concepts such as classification, regression, overfitting, and the trade-off in model complexity.\nIdentify and justify appropriate data preprocessing techniques and integrate them into machine learning pipelines.\nDemonstrate an intuitive understanding of common machine learning algorithms.\nBuild supervised machine learning pipelines using Python and scikit-learn on real-world datasets.\nApply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world. Measure and contrast the performance of various models"
